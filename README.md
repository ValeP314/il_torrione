# Il Torrione

Il Torrione is a beautiful accommodation situated in Carassai, a medieval town in Ascoli Piceno Province, Italy.
This project is aimed to propose the rental of this fantastic tower, adiacent to the original boundary walls, still visible in parts of the town.
The site will be targeted towards couples, passionate about architecture and curious to experience this exclusive setting, overlooking the Apeninnes and the Adriatic Sea.
Il Torrione website will be a useful tool to communicate with the host and ask all the questions the guests might have.  It will also allow to book some extra activities presented in the "Things to do" page.
