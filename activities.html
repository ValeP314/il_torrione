        <h2>Wine tasting</h2>

        <p>
            A wine tour in Italy offers a unique chance to experience the country’s beautiful countryside whilst enjoying the finest wine and food – and this is no ordinary wine and food, it’s some of the very best on the planet.
            We can arrange a tailor-made luxury wine tasting tour for you, covering the main vineyards of the Province.

        <h2>City sightseeing Ascoli Piceno</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/ascoli .jpg" alt="Ascoli Piceno">
        <p>
            With a continuous history dating from the Sabine tribe in the 9th century BC, Ascoli Piceno is one of Le Marche’s most refined and attractive towns. Its historic centre, mercifully flat after so many steeply stacked hillside towns, is a charming pocket of medieval streets punctuated by grand churches and photogenic piazzas. There’s a sense of grandeur here too, especially on its central squares: Piazza Arringo and Piazza del Popolo. Foodies are in for a treat: Ascoli is the birthplace of Italy’s much-loved olive all'ascolana (meat-stuffed fried olives) and wherever you go in town you’re never far from a tempting takeaway or trendy bar.
            We would be happy to organise a 2.5 hours walking tour for you, to discover this hidden gem, all decked out in travertine.

        <h2>A day to the beach</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/mare.jpg" alt="Cupra Marittima, le Marche region">
        <p>
            The seaside town of Cupra Marittima is situated on the Adriatic Sea in the Province of Ascoli Piceno. The main highlights include the beach, awarded with the Blue flag for its 2 Km sandy strands, the promenade and Cupra Alta.
            Cupra Alta or Marano offers a amazing view over the sea and the Palm tree Riviera. 
        </p>

        <h2>Hiking in the Central Apennine</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/apennines.jpg" alt="Sibillini mountains">
        <p>
            Walking is probably the best way to visit the park, because you can experience nature, history, landscape, at the right pace. Walks are generally not too difficult or excessively long, because distances are short, and in most of cases you can choose how long an experience you desire. 
            Most walks are easy, family friendly, and don't require much equipment.
